# Bubbles
Control your youtube recommendations.

Lets you use many identities for watching youtube videos.
Recommendations for every identity are completely separate.
You can also share your identities with others or import theirs.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/fifimajster/bubbles.git
cd bubbles

just open dash and run bubbles (you may need to log out 
and log in for the first time).

Otherwise run:

./bubbles.py
```

When running for the first time, firefox will ask you to choose 
your user profile.  
Click "Create Profile".  
In "enter new profile name" type "bubbles".
